Step 1
To prepare this delicious plain dosa recipe, first you need to make the dosa batter. For that, wash rice and urad dal in a bowl together under running water and then drain the extra water. Soak them both in fresh water along with fenugreek seeds overnight or for 6-8 hours. Next day, drain the extra water and add the soaked dal along with methi dana in a blender jar along with salt and water (1/4 cup). Grind to a fine paste reserve for at least 5 hours. Once done, divide it into 8 equal portions and keep aside. The dosa batter is now ready.

Step 2
Next, peel an onion and cut it into halves. Tie one half of the cut onions in a muslin cloth and dip in cooking oil. Rub the surface of a pre-heated griddle with the flat side. Warm the griddle over low heat and spread a portion of the batter over the surface by moving a laddle in concentric circles from the middle going outwards.

When little performance appear on the rapidly cooking pancake, flip it over and cook for few seconds. Ensure that the pancake does not become crisp. Repeat the process with the remaining portions of batter and make more such dosas.
